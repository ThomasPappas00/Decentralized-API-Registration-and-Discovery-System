# Overview

The realization of IoT in smart cities faces a significant obstacle in the form of interoperability challenges inside and between the five distinct architectural/conceptual layers (sensing layer, network layer, middleware layer, application layer and business layer) that form information and data silos. This project focuses on the discoverability of Layer 3 platform systems by Layer 4 applications, without prior knowledge of them, in a complex city scenario.

Layer 3 platforms abstract the sensor and networking layers from the end-user applications and are responsible for the registration, discovery and management of devices (sensors, actuators), security, semantics and communication management with other software systems. Generally, Layer 3 platforms expose RESTful northbound APIs, so Layer 4 applications can onboard and receive data and functionality. The proliferation of these APIs is a prominent issue and a common place for the accumulation of the API specifications of the platforms is necessary.

A decentralized API Directory is proposed, that can be deployed in any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible public or private blockchain. This API Directory can be used as a common place for smart-city IoT platforms to publish their API specifications, formulated on the OpenAPI specification standard, and for end-user applications to discover them based on spatial location and desired smart-city category. Furthermore, taking advantage of the inherit financial nature of the Ethereum blockchain, a proposition is implemented to extend this solution to a payable version (where API consumers pay a fee to obtain the producersâ€™ APIs) and therefore unfold a new smart city API marketplace.

## Instructions
Start a private local Ethereum blockchain instance (127.0.0.1:8545) with tools like Ganache and add the _truffle-config.js_ file to the workspace. Run _$truffle migrate_ in the root folder to compile the smart contracts _(ApiDirectory.sol, Functionality.sol, SharedStructs.sol)_ and deploy them on the blockchain. Run _node producer.js_ in the _/scripts_ folder and provide an API specification. Run _node consumer.js_ in the _/scripts_ folder and provide a x,y location (lat, lon) and a smart-city category (Parking, etc.). A single or multiple OpenAPI specifications are returned in JSON format. Now, the Layer 4 application can onboard on the desired Layer 3 platform based the API specification.
